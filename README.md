# Welcome to Bug Wrangler Ranch

This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Description

Slim Jenkins offers a vacation package for people who have always wanted to join a cattle driving team across the American Midwest.

He calls it the **Kansas Slim's Cattle Adventure**.

People join a team of experienced drovers who will train them in the basics of herding cattle and driving them across hundreds of miles to their destination at Old Red's Ranch.

Unfortunately, someone gained access to the code that produces an outline of the adventure to the paying customers, so Slim has hired you to examine and fix the code.

## Learning Objectives

Here are your learning objectives for this self-assessment.

1. Able to use the debugger to step through existing code to discover root causes of bugs.
2. Drawing a sequence diagram for a project.
   > Use the [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) site to generate your sequence diagram. Make sure you save your work as you go.
3. Demonstrate learning efficiency by researching concepts you haven't seen before using your peers, mentors, and the World Wide Web as resources.
4. Awareness of when you need help, and then seeking it out.

## Example Output

If you are able to fix all of the bugs, you will output similar to what is below. It will not be identical, but similar.

You will be accompanying 5 drovers as they drive 50 cattle to Old Red's Ranch for grazing

The herd is made of up the following types of cattle:
Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,American Angus,Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,
Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,

Here is the team of drovers you will be joining
        * Melvyn Hethron
        * Yancy Gresley
        * Willabella Attarge
        * Ynes Gyenes
        * Farlie Spere


Your journey will take you through the wildness of the American Midwest and across the following terrain
        * forest
        * plain
        * river
        * mountain
```

1. In the **main** module, one of the first lines of code is `const drovers = hireDrovers(cattleToDrive)`. Explain what the value of the `drovers` variable is when that line of code runs.
   > 'drovers' should be a list of 5 drover objects. These drovers are called through the hireDrovers function, which does two things: (1) It determines how many drovers we need based on the number of cattle. (2) It uses a loop and math to get 5 random numbers ranging from 1 to 50. It then puts the 5 drovers linked to those id numbers into the 'drovers' array.
2. At the bottom of the main module, you will see the following code - `for (const drover of drovers)`. Explain what the values of both the `drover` and the `drovers` variables are.
   > 'drovers' is just the same array of 5 objects described in question 1. 'drover' is the constant value we are using for our 'for' loop. In this loop, we are console logging out an indented message containing both the first and last names of the people in our 'drovers' list.
3. In the **journey** module, there is a `journeyMaker()` function. In that function, there is a variable named `areas` which will have the value of an object. Use your debugger to show what the value of each key is on that object. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record your session.
   > [Your public Loom URL here](https://www.loom.com/share/acf4e9975c004473869a22ffc9cc0559)
4. Also in the **journey** module, there is the following code:
   ```js
   for (let forestNumber = 0; forestNumber < areas.forests; forestNumber++) {
      journey.push("forest")
   }
   ```
   Explain this code with your best vocabulary.
   > This 'for' loop pushes our 'forest' strings into our 'journey' array. In other words, we go through the 'for' loop at most two times. We have already stated above in the 'areas' object that we have at most two forests, so when we index 'areas.forests' we are getting its number value.
5. Explain the value of the `database` variable in the **database** module. Be as comprehensive as possible.
   > In simple terms, 'database' is where we're pulling our data. It is an object that contains two arrays - 'cattleTypes' and 'drovers'. The 'cattleTypes' array holds a total of four objects, each with two key-value pairs. The first key-value pair describes the identification number of the cattle breed; the second describes the breed itself (e.g., Brown Swiss). Moving on to the second array (drovers), we have a total of 50 objects, each with four key-value pairs (id, first_name, last_name, and gender).
6. In the **drovers** module, there is a `hireDrovers()` function. You will notice the following code on that line - `(herdSize)`. What is that defining, and where does it get its value?
   > '(herdSize)' is the parameter. We get the herdSize value in the main.js module, and it is set to the variable 'cattleToDrive'. In our case, that value is the number 50, so in the 'hireDrovers()' function, we call the value of 50 and divide it by 10, since that is how we determine the number of necessary drovers. However, there is an error in the '(herdSize)' function; the current code is trying to call 'cattleToDrive' instead of our parameter. Replacing 'cattleToDrive' with 'herdSize' fixes the issue.

## When You Are Done

After you have answered all the questions above, you need to push all of your code back up to Github. Follow these instructions.

1. Be in the `bug-wrangler-ranch` directory.
2. `git add --all`
3. `git commit -m "Code complete"`
4. `git push origin main`

Then go to the Learning Platform and click the **Self-assessment Complete** button.
